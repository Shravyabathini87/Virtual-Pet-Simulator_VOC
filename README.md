# Virtual-Pet-Simulator_VOC
A Python command-line Virtual Pet Simulator where you care for a pet by feeding and playing with it, managing hunger and happiness levels. Name your pet and balance actions to keep it happy. Game ends if hunger hits 100 or happiness drops to 0. Great practice for functions, loops, and state management.
